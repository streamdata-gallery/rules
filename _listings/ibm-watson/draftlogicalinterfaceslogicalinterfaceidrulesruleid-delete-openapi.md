      description: |-
        Rules allow you to specify conditions that can be used to trigger
        actions. For example, you might create a rule that sends an email if
        the temperature of a device exceeds a certain value.

        Rules are defined against a specific logical interface schema.  At
        runtime, a rule will be evaluated whenever the state for a Device that
        exposes the logical interface changes.

        The **/logicalinterfaces/{logicalInterfaceId}/rules** endpoint returns
        the list of all of the active rules that have been associated with the
        logical interface. Various query parameters can be used to filter, sort
        and page through the list of rules that are returned.
